<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a Ph.D. candidate in Engineering at the University of Sydney, specializing in multimodal learning. I hold a Bachelor of Advanced Computing (Honours) in Computer Science and Computational Data Science from the University of Sydney (GPA 3.91/4.00, First-Class Honours, top 1%) and am supported by an Australian Government RTP Scholarship. During my undergraduate studies, I received the Ian Jackson Memorial Prize, was named a Dalyell Scholar, and consistently appeared on the Dean‚Äôs List.

My research on multimodal learning mainly focuses on:

(1) Multimodal collaborative decision-making (e.g., PET-CT with electronic health record);

(2) Cross-modality assisted learning (e.g., language-guided vision tasks);

(3) Multimodal generative methods for diagnostic support (e.g., medical visual question answering, radiology report generation).
