<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a PhD candidate in Engineering at the University of Sydney, specializing in multimodal learning. I hold a Bachelor of Advanced Computing (Honours) in Computer Science and Computational Data Science from the University of Sydney (GPA 3.91/4.00, First-Class Honours, top 1%) and am supported by an Australian Government RTP Scholarship. During my undergraduate studies, I received the Ian Jackson Memorial Prize, was named a Dalyell Scholar, and consistently appeared on the Dean‚Äôs List.

My research on multimodal learning mainly focuses on:
(1) Multimodal collaborative decision-making (e.g. PET-CT with eletronic health record);
(2) Cross-modality assisted learning (e.g., language-guided vision tasks);
(3) Multimodal generative methods for diagnostic support (e.g., medical visual question answering and radiology report generation).

	- Project Background: Utilizing a Spikerbox device, capable of recording brainwave activity, we classify various eye movements such as leftward and rightward shifts, as well as blinks. The objective of this project is to develop an intelligent e-book that autonomously turns pages and adjusts line spacing in response to the reader's behavior.  
	- Key components: 1) Deep learning-based streaming brain wave long sequence predictor; 2) Development of an intelligent book reader.
