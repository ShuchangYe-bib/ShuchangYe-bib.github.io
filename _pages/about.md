## Projects

**Brain Wave Intelligent Reader**  
*Tools*: Python, R, HTML, SQL, CSS, JavaScript, Spiker Box  
*Feb 2022 - Jun 2022*  
- Project Background: Utilizing a Spikerbox device, capable of recording brainwave activity, we classify various eye movements such as leftward and rightward shifts, as well as blinks. The objective of this project is to develop an intelligent e-book that autonomously turns pages and adjusts line spacing in response to the reader's behavior.  
- Key components: 1) Deep learning-based streaming brain wave long sequence predictor; 2) Development of intelligent book reader.
