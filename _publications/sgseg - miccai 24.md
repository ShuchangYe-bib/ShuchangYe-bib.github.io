abstract: "Existing language-guided methods require clinical reports alongside the images, and hence, they are not applicable for use in image segmentation in a decision support context, but rather limited to retrospective image analysis after clinical reporting has been completed. In this study, we propose a self-guided segmentation framework (SGSeg) that leverages language guidance for training (multi-modal) while enabling text-free inference (uni-modal), which is the first that enables text-free inference in language-guided segmentation."
